# DDR4-Memory-Architecture

Creating a clear, professional README is essential for a GitHub repository. Since your project is a highly technical, interactive visualization, the README should emphasize both the educational value and the technical implementation, explicitly noting the use of AI tools for conceptualization.

Here is a full README markdown (README.md) you can use for your public GitHub repository (ddr4-memory-viz).

ðŸ§  DDR4 Memory Architecture: Interactive Deep Dive Visualization
This project is a single-page interactive visualization that breaks down the complex DDR4 memory hierarchy, guiding users from the high-level Memory Channel down to the fundamental DRAM Cell (1T1C structure). It serves as a comprehensive educational tool for students and professionals interested in computer architecture and memory operation.

ðŸ”¬ Core Concepts Explored
The visualization uses a click-through interface to reveal increasingly granular details across seven levels of the memory hierarchy:

Channel (16 GB): Connection to the CPU and the 64-bit data bus.

DIMM (4.0 GB): The physical module and dual-rank configuration.

Rank (2.0 GB): Parallel operation of 8 chips to form the 64-bit data path.

Chip (256 MB): Internal organization into 8 independent banks.

Bank (32 MB): The 2D array structure (16,384Â rowsÃ—16,384Â columns).

Row & Column: Detailed view of Row Buffer optimization and access latency.

DRAM Cell (1T1C): The fundamental 1-Transistor, 1-Capacitor storage unit, including explanations of refresh and read/write operations.

Key technical specifications and concepts, such as DDR Burst Length (8 words/64 bytes), Bank Interleaving, and DRAM Timing Parameters (tRCD,tCAS,tRP), are presented at the relevant level.

ðŸ¤– AI-Assisted Project Genesis
This visualization was conceived, structured, and implemented with the significant assistance of AI development tools.
